# Adding Streaming Responses to AI Companion

This guide explains how to implement streaming responses from Ollama in the AI Companion extension.

## What is Streaming?

Streaming allows the AI's response to be displayed incrementally as it's being generated, rather than waiting for the complete response. This creates a more interactive and engaging user experience.

## Implementation Files

We've created several files to demonstrate and implement streaming:

1. **test_ollama_streaming.html** - A test page that demonstrates streaming responses from Ollama
2. **background_with_streaming.js** - Modified background script with streaming support
3. **content-script_with_streaming.js** - Modified content script with streaming support
4. **popup_with_streaming.js** - Modified popup script with streaming support
5. **popup_with_streaming.html** - Modified popup HTML with streaming toggle
6. **server_with_streaming.py** - Modified server script for testing
7. **STREAMING_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Detailed technical documentation

## How to Test Streaming

1. Start the server:
   ```
   python server_with_streaming.py
   ```

2. Open the test page in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:51730/test_ollama_streaming.html
   ```

3. If you have Ollama running locally:
   - Enter your Ollama server URL (default: http://localhost:11434)
   - Click "Test Connection" to verify the connection and load available models
   - Enter a prompt and click "Send" to see the streaming response

## How to Implement in the Extension

To add streaming to the extension:

1. Replace the existing files with the modified versions:
   - Replace `background.js` with `background_with_streaming.js`
   - Replace `content-script.js` with `content-script_with_streaming.js`
   - Replace `popup.js` with `popup_with_streaming.js`
   - Replace `popup.html` with `popup_with_streaming.html`

2. Update the manifest.json to reference the new files if needed

3. Test the extension to ensure streaming works correctly

## Key Changes

1. **Added Streaming Toggle**: Users can enable/disable streaming in the settings
2. **Modified API Calls**: Updated to use `stream: true` parameter with Ollama API
3. **Stream Processing**: Added code to process the stream and update the UI incrementally
4. **UI Enhancements**: Modified the UI to handle streaming updates smoothly

## Benefits of Streaming

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users see responses as they're generated, providing immediate feedback
2. **Faster Perceived Response Time**: Even though the total time is the same, users perceive the response as faster
3. **Interactive Feel**: Creates a more conversational, interactive experience

## Technical Details

For detailed technical information about the implementation, please refer to the [STREAMING_IMPLEMENTATION.md](STREAMING_IMPLEMENTATION.md) file.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with streaming:

1. **Connection Issues**: Ensure Ollama is running and accessible
2. **CORS Errors**: Run Ollama with CORS headers enabled: `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=* ollama serve`
3. **Model Issues**: Verify the model exists on your Ollama server
4. **Browser Support**: Ensure you're using a modern browser that supports the Fetch API and ReadableStream

## Feedback and Improvements

This implementation provides a foundation for streaming responses. Future improvements could include:

1. Better error handling for stream interruptions
2. Visual indicators for streaming status
3. Ability to pause/resume streaming
4. Performance optimizations for handling very long responses
