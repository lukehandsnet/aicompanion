# Grammar Functions Fix Summary

## Problem
After implementing streaming responses, the grammar functions stopped working. The issue was related to how tab IDs were being handled in the communication between content scripts and background scripts.

## Root Cause
1. The content script was incorrectly using `chrome.runtime.id` (the extension ID) as the tab ID when sending messages to the background script.
2. The background script was trying to send streaming updates back to the content script using this incorrect tab ID.
3. The mode parameter was not being properly passed through the streaming updates, causing issues with the "Apply Changes" functionality.

## Solution
The following changes were made to fix the issues:

### 1. Content Script Changes
- Removed the incorrect `tabId: chrome.runtime.id` parameter from the message sent to the background script
- Added `mode_original: mode` to preserve the mode information for streaming updates
- Updated the `updateResultUI` function to properly handle the mode parameter when applying changes
- Modified the message listener to correctly pass the mode parameter to the `updateResultUI` function

### 2. Background Script Changes
- Added code to capture the sender tab ID from incoming messages:
  ```javascript
  if (sender && sender.tab && sender.tab.id) {
      request.senderTabId = sender.tab.id;
  }
  ```
- Updated the streaming code to use this sender tab ID when sending updates back to the content script
- Added the mode parameter to streaming updates to ensure proper handling of different grammar functions
- Added error checking to prevent sending messages to invalid tab IDs

### 3. Manifest Updates
- Updated the manifest to use the streaming versions of the scripts:
  - Changed default popup to `popup_with_streaming.html`
  - Changed background service worker to `js/background_with_streaming.js`
  - Changed content script to `js/content-script_with_streaming.js`

## Benefits
- Grammar functions now work correctly with streaming responses
- The "Apply Changes" button correctly processes the text based on the grammar function used
- Error handling is improved to prevent issues with invalid tab IDs
